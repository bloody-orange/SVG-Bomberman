# SVG-Bomberman
The classic Bomberman game, created fully in plain Javascript and SVG

## Warning
This project was pretty much my introduction to Javascript.
I started out with nothing but knowledge about the syntax and ended up with a gigantic mess of plain javascript in the index.js.
This project is not meant to be easily extendable, well commented or performant. 
It was originally meant as a semester project for my university web class, but ended up basically being a big playground for me, 
and I had a ton of fun just messing around with the possibilities of the web (like the Audio API for example). 

Yes, JQuery would've probably come in handy, but it still worked out very well in my opinion, even though the code is a mess.
